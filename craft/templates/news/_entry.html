 # News entry template
 # -------------------
 #
 # This template gets loaded whenever a News entry’s URL is
 # requested. That’s because the News section’s Template setting is
 # set to “news/_entry”, the path to this template.
 #
 # When this template is loaded, it will already have an ‘entry’
 # variable, set to the requested News entry.
 #
 # See this page for more details on how Craft routes requests:
